# Sleep Age Simulator

A scientifically accurate, interactive visualization of human sleep architecture across the lifespan.

## Overview

This tool simulates how sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, REM, Wake) evolve from childhood to old age, based on peer-reviewed meta-analyses (Ohayon et al., 2004; Feinberg, 1974). It visualizes the impact of biological factors (Age, Gender, Chronotype) and lifestyle modifiers (Caffeine, Alcohol, Blue Light) on sleep quality.

## Features

*   **Interactive Hypnogram**: Real-time generation of sleep cycles based on user inputs.
*   **Two-Process Model Overlay**: Visualizes the interaction between Homeostatic Sleep Drive (Process S) and Circadian Rhythm (Process C).
*   **Advanced Modifiers**:
    *   **Caffeine**: Models half-life metabolism and adenosine blocking.
    *   **Alcohol**: Simulates biphasic effects (sedation vs. fragmentation).
    *   **Menopause**: Simulates hot flashes and efficiency loss.
    *   **Social Jet Lag**: Shifts circadian phase relative to bedtime.
*   **Clinical Metrics**: Calculates Sleep Efficiency (SE), Time in Bed (TIB), and Total Sleep Time (TST).

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation or server required.

## Scientific Basis

The simulation logic is derived from:
*   *Ohayon, M. M., et al. (2004). Meta-analysis of quantitative sleep parameters from childhood to old age.*
*   *Borbély, A. A. (1982). A two process model of sleep regulation.*
